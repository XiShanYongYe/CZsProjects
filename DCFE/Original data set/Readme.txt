We gathere 25 real-world business processes, 10 of which contain deadlocks, 10 of which contain lack of 
synchronization errors, and 5 of which contain both. Most of these business processes are from SAP or IBM, 
four of these business processes are made by ourself.

Based on these real-world business processes, we then simulate their executions repeatedly to obtain 
sufficient event sequences, and a total of 25 event logs are obtained.
